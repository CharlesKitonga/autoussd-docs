# Build A Sample App - Flutter

In the [Build a Sample App - Setup](./05.Build-Sample-App-Setup) guide, we setup an app on our dashboard and a session to send money from a Vodafone mobile money account to another.

In this guide, weâ€™ll build a simple sample **Flutter** app which will utilize our session.

# Requirements

1. Android Studio or VS Code
2. Flutter 2.5.3 or higher
3. Android `minSdkVersion` of 23 or higher

# Clone Sample Starter App

To get started, clone the sample starter app using the command below

```shell
git clone https://github.com/autoussd/autoussd-sample-flutter.git
```

# Install AutoUssd

Next, we'll install the SDK in our cloned starter app

1. Open your terminal and run the following command

```sh
flutter pub add autoussdflutter
```

2. Test if the everything is working correctly by running the app either on a physical device or on the Android emulator. If all is well, you should get an interface similar to this:

# Configure `MainActivity.kt`

AutoUssdFlutter uses the new [AndroidX Activity Result APIs](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result#kotlin) which means your `MainActivity` must inherit from a [ComponentActivity](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/activity/ComponentActivity) or a sub-class of it. Follow the steps below to modify your `MainActivity` accordingly:

1. Open your `MainActivity.kt` in the Android module of your Flutter app. If your package name is `com.example.product`, your `MainActivity.kt` will be located at `/android/app/src/kotlin/com/example/product/MainActivity.kt`
2. Your file should look like the sample below:

```kotlin
package com.example.product

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterActivity() {
}
```

3. Change your `MainActivity.kt` to look like this

```kotlin
package com.example.product

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterFragmentActivity() {
}
```

# Setup `AndroidManifest.xml`

Now, weâ€™ll now configure the `AndroidManifest.xml` of the Android component of our app to retrieve the sessions in our app on our dashboard

1. Copy your **app id** from your app in your dashboard

2. Add a `<meta-data/>` tag in the `AndroidManifest.xml` and paste your **app id** as its value

```xml
<application>
  ...
    
  <!-- TODO: Add AutoUssd app id meta-data tag -->
  <meta-data 
    android:name="com.autoussd.APP_ID" 
    android:value="YOUR APP ID"
  />
</application>
```

# Setup `main.dart`

The last thing to do is to invoke the SDK to execute our session. 

The `main.dart` code is quite long, so we'll just be replacing the following `TODO` statements with sample code for sake of brevity.

1. Declare AutoUssd SDK

```dart
// TODO #1: Declare AutoUssd SDK reference
```

```dart
// TODO #1: Declare AutoUssd SDK reference
late final AutoUssdFlutter sdk;
```

2. Setup the AutoUssd SDK instance

```dart
// TODO #2 Setup AutoUssd SDK instance
```

```dart
// TODO #2 Setup AutoUssd SDK instance
sdk = AutoUssdFlutter(
    (int count) {
        setState(() {
        	ready = count > 0;
        });
    },
    (Result result) {
        if (result.status == ResultStatus.COMPLETED) {
            showDialog(
                context: context,
                builder: (context) {
                    return AlertDialog(
                        content: Text(result.lastContent ?? "Completed!"),
                    );
                },
            );
        } else {
        	debugPrint("Something went wrong! ${result.status}");
        }
    },
);
```

3. Call the execute method on the AutoUssd SDK instance in the `completeTransaction` function

```dart
// TODO #3: Call execute method on the AutoUssd SDK instance
```

```dart
// TODO #3: Call execute method on the AutoUssd SDK instance
sdk.executeSession(
    "YOUR SESSION ID HERE",
    [number, amount.toString(), reference],
);
```

# For The Laid Back Devs

If you'd rather not go through the tutorial and examples, you can checkout the `sdk-testing` branch which contains the full implementation of AutoUssd. Check it out using the command

```bash
git checkout sdk-testing
```

# Testing

Awesome, weâ€™ve finished our setup. Our app should now be able to execute our session to transfer money from a Vodafone account to another via Vodafone Cash.

A few notes to consider

1. This guide works for a **Vodafone cash enabled SIM card**. If you use another networks, modify the guide where necessary.
2. Youâ€™ll need an internet connection for the first run. This allows the SDK to download the app and session data from the server
3. **The app will transfer actual money to the specified recipient number**

Now letâ€™s run our app and test it.

# Conclusion

Yaaay ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰! Youâ€™ve reached the end of this guide and have built your first app using AutoUssd!

Youâ€™ve just scratched the surface of how you can use USSD session automation in Android apps. Whether building apps for personal use or commercial use, the possibilities are endless. Weâ€™d love to see the many awesome ways you will use AutoUssd ðŸ˜Š.

If you encounter any problems, kindly open an issue on our [Github Issues](https://github.com/autoussd/autoussd-aar/issues) page and weâ€™ll respond swiftly to them. Now go and create the next big thing!
